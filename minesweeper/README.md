# Minesweeper

The classic puzzle game brought to Dev Platform custom posts.

The app uses custom posts, useState, useInterval, Menu Actions, the Reddit API Client, and Images.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

- Create a new post from the subreddit menu dropdown.
- Select the difficulty level of the game
- Clear all the cells without triggering a bomb (each cell notates how many bombs are adjacent).

The game logic is handled in the game.ts file. UI and rendering components are separated into the components folder.

Developers case use this code, or any snippets from the app, as a template for their own projects.
