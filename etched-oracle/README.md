# Etched Oracle

Magic the Gathering fans, rejoice!

The Etched Oracle retrieves MTG card images, linked stats, and more when summoned in a community.

The app uses http fetch, the RTJSON builder, triggers, the Reddit API Client, and subreddit configuration settings.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

- Install the [Etched Oracle](https://developers.reddit.com/apps/etched-oracle) on a subreddit you moderate.
- Mention a MTG card name in double brackets. For example, "[[Scuttling Doom Engine]]".
- The app will return a comment that pulls card information from the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/card/m15/229/scuttling-doom-engine).

Developers case use this code, or any snippets from the app, as a template for their own projects.
