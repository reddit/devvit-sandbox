# Modlog Archive

This is an app that allows moderators to archive their moderation logs as posts within a separate mods-only subreddit.

The app uses three main Devvit features: triggers, the Reddit API Client, and subreddit configuration settings.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

- Install the [modlog archive app](https://developers.reddit.com/apps/modlog-archive) on a subreddit you moderate.
- In the app settings, add the private moderation subreddit where you want to archive your team's modlog and decide if Automod events should be included.
- Let the app run!

Developers case use this code, or any snippets from the app, as a template for their own projects.
